# Planning for a rewrite of finger weather service at graph.no

Old API will close down 01.05.2021, so should migrate before that.

## Legacy components

* finger handler (source was never published) using SocketServer
* https://gitlab.com/larsfp/pyyrascii
* https://github.com/ways/pyyrlib
* https://github.com/ways/pyofflinefilecache

All in python 2. Looks up location via a one-time imported mysql database.

## Important features to keep
- [x] Usage text
- [x] Imperial units
- [x] Caching forecast data (required by API)
- [x] Caching location data
- [ ] Fix timezone (now UTC?)
- [ ] Show time in location's timezone

## Important features to add/improve

- [x] Better location searching (country -> city)
- [x] Optional wind chill
- [x] Better logging
- [x] Dates if period cross days (requested by a user)
- [x] Unit testing
- [x] Increase wind direction precision
- [x] Allow searching by coordinate
- [ ] Scale rain better for imperial (i.e. 0.1 in. increments instead of 1)

## Features that can be dropped

- [ ] One-liner

## Show stoppers

- [x] Searching improvements may be dependent on changes to the library (library replaced)

## Nice to have

- [x] Deny-list, for abusers
- [x] Screenwidth ~
- [ ] Options like % and +
- [x] Random message at bottom
- [ ] Make met.no lib convert precipitation unit, and push upstream.
- [ ] Time API look-ups, to see what's slow
- [ ] Fetch sun times, to display sun up/down like in old API
