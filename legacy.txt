# Planning for a rewrite of finger weather service at graph.no

Old API will close down 01.05.2021, so should migrate before that.

## Legacy components

* finger handler (source was never published) using SocketServer
* https://gitlab.com/larsfp/pyyrascii
* https://github.com/ways/pyyrlib
* https://github.com/ways/pyofflinefilecache

All in python 2. Looks up location via a one-time imported mysql database.

## Important features to keep
- [x] Usage text
- [x] Imperial units
- [x] Caching forecast data (required by API)
- [ ] Caching location data
- [ ] Show time in location's timezone (currently showing in local timezone or UTC. Not sure.)

## Important features to add/improve

- [x] Better location searching (country -> city)
- [ ] Feels-like
- [x] Better logging
- [x] Dates if period cross days
- [x] Unit testing
- [ ] Increase wind direction precision
- [ ] Allow searching by coordinate

## Features that can be dropped

- [ ] One-liner

## Show stoppers

- [x] Searching improvements may be dependent on changes to the library (library replaced)

## Nice to have

- [ ] Deny-list, for abusers
- [ ] Options like %, ~ and +
- [ ] Random message at bottom
- [ ] Make met.no lib convert precipitation unit, and push upstream.
